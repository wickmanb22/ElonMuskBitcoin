The timing is strange, just as we are getting a rapid
increase in 3rd party coverage after getting
slashdotted. I hope there’s not a big hurry to wrap
the discussion and decide. How long does Wikipedia
typically leave a question like that open for
comment?
It would help to condense the article and make it less
promotional sounding as soon as possible. Just
letting people know what it is, where it fits into the
electronic money space, not trying to convince them
that it’s good. They probably want something that

just generally identifies what it is, not tries to explain
all about how it works.

If you post in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_del
etion/Bitcoin please don’t say “yeah, but bitcoin is
really important and special so the rules shouldn’t
apply” or argue that the rule is dumb or unfair. That
only makes it worse. Try to address how the rule is
satisfied.
Search “bitcoin” on google and see if you can find
more big references in addition to the infoworld and
slashdot ones. There may be very recent stuff being
written by reporters who heard about it from the
slashdot article.
I hope it doesn’t get deleted. If it does, it’ll be hard to
overcome the presumption. Institutional momentum
is to stick with the last decision. (edit: or at least I
assume so, that’s how the world usually works, but
maybe Wiki is different)
