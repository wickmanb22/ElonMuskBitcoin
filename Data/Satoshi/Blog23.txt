We had our first automatic adjustment of the proofof-work difficulty on 30 Dec 2009.
The minimum difficulty is 32 zero bits, so even if only
one person was running a node, the difficulty doesn’t
get any easier than that. For most of last year, we
were hovering below the minimum. On 30 Dec we
broke above it and the algorithm adjusted to more
difficulty. It’s been getting more difficult at each
adjustment since then.
The adjustment on 04 Feb took it up from 1.34 times
last year’s difficulty to 1.82 times more difficult than
last year. That means you generate only 55% as
many coins for the same amount of work.
The difficulty adjusts proportionally to the total effort
across the network. If the number of nodes doubles,

the difficulty will also double, returning the total
generated to the target rate.
For those technically inclined, the proof-of-work
difficulty can be seen by searching on “target:” in
debug.log. It’s a 256bit unsigned hex number, which
the SHA-256 value has tobe less than to successfully
generate a block. It gets adjusted every 2016 blocks,
typically two weeks. That’s when it prints
