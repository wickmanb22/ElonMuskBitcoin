A rational market price for something that is
expected to increase in value will already reflect the
present value of the expected future increases. In
your head, you do a probability estimate balancing
the odds that it keeps increasing.
In the absence of a market to establish the price,
NewLibertyStandard’s estimate based on production
cost is a good guess and a helpful service (thanks).
The price of any commodity tends to gravitate
toward the production cost. If the price is below cost,
then production slows down. If the price is above

cost, profit can be made by generating and selling
more. At the same time, the increased production
would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of
generating towards the price.
In later years, when new coin generation is a small
percentage of the existing supply, market price will
dictate the cost of production more than the other
way around.
At the moment, generation effort is rapidly
increasing, suggesting people are estimating the
present value to be higher than the current cost of
production.
