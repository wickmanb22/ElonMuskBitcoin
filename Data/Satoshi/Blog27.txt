Full size 530x529 image for scaling down to custom
sizes:

The perspective shadow was too thick on the larger
sizes. Iupdated 32, 48 and the full size.
I release these images into the public domain
(copyright-free). I request that derivative works be
made public domain.

Good suggestion. I made the B slightly lighter and
the background slightly darker. Very slightly. The

foreground is now exactly the same colour as the BC
in the old one.
It’s kind of OK if you can’t easily read the B in the
16x16. At that size, you just need to see that it’s a
coin. It doesn’t matter so much what’s embossed on
it, just that there be some detail therebecause it
wouldn’t look like a coin if it was a blank smooth
circle.
It’s slightly wider than tall because the dark
perspective under it goes more to the right than
down.
I finished and posted the 32x31 and 48x47 versions
in the first message. I like the 48 a lot.
How does everyone feel about the B symbol with the
two lines through the outside? Can we live with that
as our logo?

I don’t know how to do SVG, but I did the original
very large, over500 pixels across, so it can be scaled
down. I’ll give the original when I’m finished.
I had to custom tweak each icon size so the vertical
lines land square on their pixels, otherwise they’re
ugly blurry and inconsistent. Such is the challenge of

making icons. The original will be good for scaling to
custom sizes between 48 and 500 but not smaller.
