There would be a command line switch at runtime to
tell it to run without UI. All it needs to do is not
create the main window. A simplistic way would be to
disable “pframeMain->Show” and “ptaskbaricon-
>Show” in ui.cpp. The network threads don’t care
that the UI isn’t there. The only other UI is a message
box in CheckDiskSpace if it runs out of disk space.
Then a separate command line utility to
communicate with it to do things. Not sure what it
should be named.

“natural deflation”... I like that name for it. Yes, there
will be natural deflation due to payment mistakes
and lost data. Coin creation will eventually get slow
enough that it is exceeded by natural deflation and
we’ll have net deflation.

Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth
slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.

Computers have to get about 2^200 times faster
before that starts to be a problem. Someone with
lots of compute power could make more money by
generating than by trying to steal.
