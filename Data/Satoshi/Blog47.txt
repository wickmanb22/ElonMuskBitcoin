I’m doing something like that. Priority is a more
formalised version of the concept you’re describing.

Yes, like this. And the no-priority-requirement area is
3K, about a dozen transactions per block.

I just uploaded SVN rev 185 which has a minimal
priority requirement for free transactions.
Transaction floods are made up of coins that are respent over and over, so they depend ontheir own 0
conf transactions repeatedly. 0 conf transactions
have 0 priority, so free transactions like that will
have to wait for one transaction to get into a block at
a time.
Version 0.3.15 doesn’t write transactions using 0
conf dependencies unless that’s all it has left, so
normal users shouldn’t usually have a problem with
this.

I think this is a good compromise short of making the
default fee 0.01. It’s not so much to ask that free
transactions can only be used to turn coins over so
often. If you’re using free transactions, you’re taking
charity and there has to be some limit on how often
you can use it with the same coins.
We’ve always said free transactions may be
processed more slowly. You can help ensure your
transactions go through quickly by
addingpaytxfee=0.01.
