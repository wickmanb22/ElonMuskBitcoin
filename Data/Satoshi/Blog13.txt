I would be surprised if 10 years from now we’re not
using electronic currency in some way, now that we
know a way to do it that won’t inevitably get dumbed
down when the trusted third party gets cold feet.
It could get started in a narrow niche like reward
points, donation tokens, currency for a game or
micropayments for adult sites. Initially it can be used
in proof-of-work applications for services that could
almost be free but not quite.
It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The
send dialog is resizeable and you can enter as long
of a message as you like. It’s sent directly when it
connects. The recipient doubleclicks on the
transaction to see the full message. If someone
famous is getting more e-mail than they can read,
but would still like to have a way for fans to contact
them, they could set up Bitcoin and give out the IP
address on their website. “Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I’ll read the message
personally.”
Subscription sites that need some extra proof-ofwork for their free trial so it doesn’t cannibalize
subscriptions could charge bitcoins for the trial.

It might make sense just to get some in case it
catches on. If enough people think the same way,
that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Once it gets
bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you
could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as
easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.
