The proof-of-work chain is the solution to the
synchronisation problem, and to knowing what the
globally shared view is without having to trust
anyone.
A transaction will quickly propagate throughout the
network, so if two versions of the same transaction
were reported at close to the same time, the one
with the head start would have a big advantage in
reaching many more nodes first. Nodes will only
accept the first one they see, refusing the second
one to arrive, so the earlier transaction would have
many more nodes working on incorporating it into
the next proof-of-work. In effect, each node votes for
its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by
including it in its proof-of-work effort.
If the transactions did come at exactly the same time
and there was an even split, it’s a toss up based on
which gets into a proof-of-work first, and that decides
which is valid.
When a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is
propagated throughout the network and everyone
adds it to the chain and starts working on the next
block after it. Any nodes that had the other
transaction will stop trying to include it in a block,

since it’s now invalid according to the accepted
chain.
The proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof
that it came from the globally shared view. Only the
majority of the network together has enough CPU
power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-ofwork. Any user, upon receiving the proof-of-work
chain, can see what the majority of the network has
approved. Once a transaction is hashed into a link
that’s a few links back in the chain, it is firmly etched
into the global history.
