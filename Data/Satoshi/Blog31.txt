Excellent choice of a first project, nice work. I had
planned to do this exact thing if someone else didnâ€™t
do it, so when it gets too hard for mortals to
generate 50BTC, new users could get some coins to
play with right away. Donations should be able to
keep it filled. The display showing the balance in the
dispenser encourages people to top it up.
You should put a donation bitcoin address on the
page for those who want to add funds to it, which
ideally should update to a new address whenever it
receives something.

5 BTC seems like a lot these days, maybe the normal
amount should be 1 or 2 BTC.
This is an important service so new users can at
least get something if generating is too hard.
