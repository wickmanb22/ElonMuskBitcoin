Right, it’s ECC digital signatures. A new key pair is
used for every transaction.
It’s not pseudonymous in the sense of identifying
people, but it is at least a little pseudonymous in that
the next action on a coin can be identified as being
from the owner of that coin.

There is no reliance on identifying anyone. As you’ve
said, it’s futile and can be trivially defeated with sock
puppets.
The credential that establishes someone as real is
the ability to supply CPU power.

Section 11 calculates the worst case under attack.
Typically, 5 or 10 blocks is enough for that. If you’re
selling something that doesn’t merit a network-scale
attack to steal it, in practice you could cut it closer.

This is a version 2 problem that I believe can be
solved fairly satisfactorily for most applications.
The race is to spread your transaction on the
network first. Think 6 degrees of freedom it spreads
exponentially. It would only take something like 2
minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough
that a competitor starting late would have little
chance of grabbing very many nodes before the first
one is overtaking the whole network.
During those 2 minutes, the merchant’s nodes can
be watching for a double-spent transaction. The
double-spender would not be able to blast his
alternate transaction out to the world without the
merchant getting it, so he has to wait before
starting.
If the real transaction reaches 90% and the doublespent tx reaches 10%, the double-spender only gets
a 10% chance of not paying, and 90% chance his
money gets spent. For almost any type of goods,
that’s not going to be worth it for the scammer.
Information based goods like access to website or
downloads are non-fencible. Nobody is going to be
able to make a living off stealing access to websites
or downloads. They can go to the file sharing
networks to steal that. Most instant-access products
aren’t going to have a huge incentive to steal.
If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they
can make the customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for
something in e-mail, which many already do. If they
really want to optimize, and it’s a large download,
they could cancel the download in the middle if the
transaction comes back double-spent. If it’s website

access, typically it wouldn’t be a big deal to let the
customer have access for 5 minutes and then cut off
access if it’s rejected. Many such sites have a free
trial anyway.
