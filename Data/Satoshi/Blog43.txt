Some places where generation will gravitate to:
1) places where it’s cheapest or free
2) people who want to help for idealogical reasons
3) people who want to get some coins without the
inconvenience of doing a transaction to buy them
There are legitimate places where it’s free.
Generation is basically free anywhere that has
electric heat, since your computer’s heat is offsetting
your baseboard electric heating. Many small flats
have electric heat out of convenience.
How expensive is heating oil? With the price of oil so
high, if it’s actually more expensive than electric,
then generating would have negative cost.
There’s also kids putting it on their parent’s power
bill, employees their employer, botnets, etc.

Case 3 comes into play for small amounts. The
overhead of doing an exchange doesn’t make sense
if you just need a small bit of pocket change for
incidental micropayments. I think this is a nice
advantage vs fiat currency, instead of all the
seigniorage going to one big entity, let it go in
convenience amounts to people who need to scrape
up a small amount of change.
