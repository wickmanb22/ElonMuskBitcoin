A transaction can be written that requires two
signatures to spend it next. You write a payment that
requires the signature of both the recipient and the
sender to spend it. To release the escrow, you give
the recipient the signature for your half, or the payee
can return it by giving you his signed half. There’s no
mediator in this simple case. The recourse is to
refuse to ever release it, essentially burning the
money.

Really? Do you think people won’t be able to
understand the benefit? (If your response is an
argument that there’s no benefit at all, I guess that

will reinforce the case that people won’t be able to
understand it.)
