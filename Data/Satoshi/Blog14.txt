Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW
tokens have value: there would be a profit motive for
people to set up massive quantities of fake e-mail
accounts to harvest POW tokens from spam. They’d
essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
automated mailboxes that collect their POW and
don’t read the message. The ratio of fake mailboxes
to real people could become too high for spam to be
cost effective.
The process has the potential to establish the POW
token’s value in the first place, since spammers that
don’t have a botnet could buy tokens from
harvesters. While the buying back would temporarily
let more spam through, it would only hasten the selfdefeating cycle leading to too many harvesters
exploiting the spammers.
Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has
a form of spam called “dusting”. Spammers send a
tiny amount of gold dust in order to put a spam
message in the transaction’s comment field. If the
system let users configure the minimum payment
they’re willing to receive, or at least the minimum
that can have a message with it, users could set how
much they’re willing to get paid to receive spam.
