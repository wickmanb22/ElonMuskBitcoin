It’s not implemented yet, but the network can
support a transaction that requires two
signatures. It’s described here:

It’s absolutely safer than a straight payment
without escrow, but not as good as a human
arbitrated escrow, assuming you trust the human
enough.
In this kind of escrow, a cheater can’t win, but
it’s still possible for you to lose. It at least takes
away the profit motive for cheating you. The
seller is assured that the money is reserved for
him, while the buyer retains the leverage that
the seller hasn’t been paid yet until completion.
