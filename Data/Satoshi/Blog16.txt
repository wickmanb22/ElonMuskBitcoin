It looks like we’re through with the worst of the
Internet connection issues. 0.1.3 fixed a problem
where your node’s communications could go dead
after a while. The network is running much more
smoothly now with this version.
If you’ve successfully generated a block, you’ve seen
it has a maturation countdown before you can spend
it. Once it matures, the Credit column will change
from 0.00 to 50.00. For a block to be valid, it has to
be broadcasted to the network and get into the block
chain, which is why Generate does not run if you’re
not connected. If you generated a block without
being connected, the network wouldn’t know about it
and would continue building the chain without it,

leaving it behind, and the maturation countdown
would change to “(not accepted)” when your node
sees that it wasn’t used. If you subtract 1 from the
status column, that’s how many blocks have been
chained after yours.
