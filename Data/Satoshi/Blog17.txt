The current version will work fine. They’ll each
connect over the Internet, while incoming
connections only come to the host that port 8333 is
routed to.

As an optimisation, I’ll make a switch “-
connect=1.2.3.4” to make it only connect to a
specific address. You could make your extra nodes
connect to your primary, and only the primary
connects over the Internet. It doesn’t really matter
for now, since the network would have to get huge
before the bandwidth is anything more than trivial.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp
server for transactions. A few lines of code could
create a transaction with an extra hash in it of
anything that needs to be timestamped. I should add
a command to timestamp a file that way.

Right, and I’d like to see more of a library
interface that could be called from programming
or scripting languages, on the client side as well.
