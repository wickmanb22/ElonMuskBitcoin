If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we
could come to some agreement about what the
honest block chain was before the trouble started,
lock that in and continue from there with a new hash
function.
If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could
transition to a new hash in an orderly way. The
software would be programmed to start using a new
hash after a certain block number. Everyone would
have to upgrade by that time. The software could
save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure
a different block with the same old hash can’t be
used.

True, if it happened suddenly. If it happens gradually,
we can still transition to something stronger. When
you run the upgraded software for the first time, it
would re-sign all your money with the new stronger
signature algorithm. (by creating a transaction
sending the money to yourself with the stronger sig)

SHA256 is not like the step from 128 bit to 160 bit.
To use an analogy, it’s more like the step from 32-bit
to 64-bit address space. We quickly ran out of
address space with 16-bit computers, we ran out of
address space with 32-bit computers at 4GB, that

doesn’t mean we’re going to run out again with 64-
bit anytime soon.
SHA256 is not going to be broken by Moore’s law
computational improvements in our lifetimes. If it’s
going to get broken, it’ll be by some breakthrough
cracking method. An attack that could so thoroughly
vanquish SHA256 to bring it within computationally
tractable range has a good chance of clobbering
SHA512 too.
If we see a weakness in SHA256 coming gradually,
we can transition to a new hash function after a
certain block number. Everyone would have to
upgrade their software by that block number. The
new software would keep a new hash of all the old
blocks to make sure they’re not replaced with
another block with the same old hash.
