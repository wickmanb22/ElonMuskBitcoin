What happens then?
They both broadcast their blocks. All nodes receive
them and keep both, but only work on the one they
received first. We’ll suppose exactly half received
one first, half the other.
In a short time, all the transactions will finish
propagating so that everyone has the full set. The
nodes working on each side will be trying to add the
transactions that are missing from their side. When
the next proof-of-work is found, whichever previous
block that node was working on, that branch
becomes longer and the tie is broken. Whichever
side it is, the new block will contain the other half of
the transactions, so in either case, the branch will
contain all transactions. Even in the unlikely event
that a split happened twice in a row, both sides of
the second split would contain the full set of
transactions anyway.
It’s not a problem if transactions have to wait one or
a few extra cycles to get into a block.
