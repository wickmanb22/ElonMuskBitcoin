It is a bit tricky because we have to figure out how to improve the cost of trips to Mars by five million percent. This
translates to an improvement of approximately four-and-ahalf orders of magnitude. This is not easy. It sounds virtually
impossible, but there are ways to do it.
These are the key elements that are needed in order to
achieve the four-and-a-half orders of magnitude improvement. Most of the improvement would come from full reusabilityâ€”somewhere between two and two-and-a-half orders
of magnitude. The other two orders of magnitude would come
from refilling in orbit, propellant production on Mars, and
choosing the right propellant
