Figure 19 shows the future—next steps. We were intentionally fuzzy about this timeline. However, we are going to
try to make as much progress as we can on a very constrained
budget, on the elements of the interplanetary transport booster
and spaceship. Hopefully, we will be able to complete the first
development spaceship in maybe about 4 years, and we will
start doing suborbital flights with that.
It has enough capability that you could possibly go to orbit
if you limit the amount of cargo on the spaceship. You would
have to really strip it down, but in tanker form, it could definitely get to orbit. It cannot get back, but it can get to orbit.
Maybe there is some market for the really fast transport of
things around the world, provided we can land somewhere
where noise is not a super-big deal because rockets are very
noisy. We could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45
minutes at the most. Hence, most places on Earth would be
20–25 minutes away. If we had a floating platform off the
coast of New York, 20–30 miles out, you could go from New
York to Tokyo in 25 minutes and across the Atlantic in 10
minutes. Most of your time would be spent getting to the ship, and then it would be very quick after that. Therefore, there are
some intriguing possibilities there, although we are not
counting on that.
Then, there is the development of the booster. The booster
part is relatively straightforward because it amounts to a
scaling up of the Falcon 9 booster. So, we do not see that there
will be many showstoppers there.
Then it will be a case of trying to put it all together and make
this actually work for Mars. If things go super-well, it might be
in the 10-year timeframe, but I do not want to say that is when
it will occur. There is a huge amount of risk. It is going to cost a
lot. There is a good chance we will not succeed, but we are
going to do our best and try to make as much progress as
possible.
