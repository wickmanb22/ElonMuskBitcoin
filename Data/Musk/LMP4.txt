The next key element is propulsive landing. In order to land on a place like the Moon where there is no atmosphere and certainly no runways, or to land on Mars where the atmosphere is too thin to land with wings even if there were runways, you really have to get propulsive landing perfect.

Propulsive landing is what we have been practicing with Falcon 9 (Fig. 2). As of the time of this presentation, SpaceX has had 16 successful landings and that is really without any redundancy. Falcon 9's final landing is always done with a single engine whereas with BFR, we will always have multi-engine out capability. You want minimum pucker factor on landingâ€”you need to be able to essentially count on the landing. If you can get to a very high reliability with even a single engine, and then you can land with either of two engines, I think we can get to a landing reliability that is on par with the safest commercial airliners.

Falcon 9 can also land with very high precision. In fact, we believe the precision at this point is good enough that we will not need legs for the next version. It will literally land with so much precision that it will land back on its launch mounts.
