The key is making this affordable to almost anyone who
wants to go (Fig. 17). Based on this architecture, assuming
optimization over time, we are looking at a cost per ticket of
<$200,000, maybe as little as $100,000 over time, depending
upon how much mass a person takes.
Right now, we are estimating about $140,000 per ton for
the trips to Mars. If a person plus their luggage is less than
that, taking into account food consumption and life support,
the cost of moving to Mars could ultimately drop below
$100,000.
Obviously, it is going to be a challenge to fund this
whole endeavor. We expect to generate a pretty decent net cash flow from launching lots of satellites and servicing the
space station for NASA, transferring cargo to and from the
space station.
There are also many people in the private sector who are
interested in helping to fund a base on Mars, and perhaps
there will be interest on the government sector side to do that
too. Ultimately, this is going to be a huge public–private
partnership.
Right now, we are just trying to make as much progress as
we can with the resources that we have available and to keep
the ball moving forward. As we show that this is possible and
that this dream is real—it is not just a dream, it is something
that can be made real—the support will snowball over time.
I should also add that the main reason I am personally
accumulating assets is in order to fund this. I really do not
have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets
except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to
making life multi-planetary.
