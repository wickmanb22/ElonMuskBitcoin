By talking about the SpaceX Mars architecture, I want
to make Mars seem possible—make it seem as though
it is something that we can do in our lifetime. There
really is a way that anyone could go if they wanted to.
WHY GO ANYWHERE?
I think there are really two fundamental paths. History is
going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on
Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction
event. I do not have an immediate doomsday prophecy, but
eventually, history suggests, there will be some doomsday event.
The alternative is to become a space-bearing civilization
and a multi-planetary species, which I hope you would agree
is the right way to go.
So how do we figure out how to take you to Mars and create
a self-sustaining city—a city that is not merely an outpost but
which can become a planet in its own right, allowing us to
become a truly multi-planetary species (see Fig. 1)?
