We are going to try to send something to Mars on every
Mars rendezvous from this point on. We plan to send Dragon
2, which is a propulsive lander, to Mars in a couple of years,
and then probably do another Dragon mission in 2020
(Fig. 20).
We want to establish a steady cadence, so that there is always a flight leaving, just like there is a train leaving the
station. With every Mars rendezvous, we will be sending at
least a Dragon to Mars and ultimately the big spaceship. If
there are people who are interested in putting payloads on
Dragon, you know you can count on a ship that is going to
transport something on the order of at least two or three tons
of useful payloads to the surface of Mars.
That is part of the reason why we designed Dragon 2 to be a
propulsive lander. As a propulsive lander, you can go anywhere in the solar system. You could go to the moon. You
could go to, well, anywhere! However, if something relies on
wings, you can pretty much only land on Earth because you need a runway, and most places do not have a runway. As for
parachutes, you cannot use those anywhere that does not have
a dense atmosphere. However, propulsive works anywhere.
Therefore, we should be able to land Dragon on any solid or
liquid surface in the solar system.
