Figure 8 gives you a rough sense of rocket capability, starting off at the low end with the Falcon 1 at a half-ton and then going up to BFR at 150 tons. I think it is important to note that BFR has more capability than Saturn V even with full reusability. But here is the really important, fundamental point—let us look at the launch cost.

When you look at the vehicles against marginal launch cost, the order reverses (Fig. 9). I know at first glance this may seem ridiculous but it is not. The same is true of aircraft. If you bought a small, single-engine turboprop aircraft—that would be one and a half to two million dollars. To charter a 747 from California to Australia is half a million dollars, there and back. The single-engine turboprop cannot even get to Australia. So a fully reusable giant aircraft like the 747 costs a third as much as an expendable tiny aircraft. In one case you have to build an entire aircraft, in the other case you just have to refuel something. It is really crazy that we build these sophisticated rockets and then crash them every time we fly. This is mad. I cannot emphasize how profound this is and how important reusability is. Often I will be told, “but you could get more payload if you made it expendable.” I say “yes, you could also get more payload from an aircraft if you got rid of the landing gear and the flaps and just parachute out when you got to your destination. But that would be crazy and you would sell zero aircraft.” So reusability is absolutely fundamental.
