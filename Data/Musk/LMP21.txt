Based on our calculations, we can actually do lunar surface missions with no propellant production on the surface of the Moon (Fig. 12). If we do a high elliptic parking orbit for the ship and retank in high elliptic orbit, we can go all the way to the Moon and back with no local propellant production on the Moon (Fig. 13). I think that would enable the creation of Moon Base Alpha or some sort of lunar base. It is 2017. We should have a lunar base by now.

Becoming a multi-planet species beats the hell out of being a single planet species. We would start off by sending a mission to Mars where it would be obviously just landing on rocky ground or dusty ground.
