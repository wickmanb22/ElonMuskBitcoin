The size of this being a nine meter diameter vehicle is a huge enabler for new satellites. We can actually send something that is almost nine meters in diameter to orbit. For example, if you want to do a new Hubble, you could send a mirror that has 10 times the surface area of the current Hubble, as a single unit that does not have to unfold. You could send a large number of small satellites. You can actually go around and, if you wanted to, collect old satellites or clean up space debrisâ€”that may be something we have to do in the future. The fairing would open up, retract and then come back down, enabling launching of Earth satellites that are significantly larger than anything we have done before or significantly more satellites at a time than anything that has been done before (Fig. 10).
