Falcon 1 is where we started out. A lot of people really only heard of SpaceX relatively recently, so they may think Falcon 9 and Dragon just instantly appeared and that's how it always was—but it wasn't. We started off with just a few people who really didn't know how to make rockets. And the reason that I ended up being the chief engineer or chief designer, was not because I wanted to, it's because I couldn't hire anyone. Nobody good would join, I ended up being that by default. And I messed up the first three launches, the first three launches failed. Fortunately the fourth launch—which was the last money that we had for Falcon 1—the fourth launch worked, or that would have been it for SpaceX. But fate liked us that day. So the fourth launch worked and it's interesting—today is the ninth anniversary of that launch. I didn't realize that until I was told that just earlier today but this is a very emotional day, actually.

Falcon 1 was quite a small rocket. When we were doing Falcon 1 we were really trying to figure out, “What is the smallest useful payload that we could get to orbit?” We thought, okay, something that could launch around half a ton to low Earth orbit. And that is how we sized Falcon 1, but it is really quite small compared to Falcon 9.
