To make Mars trips possible on a large enough scale to
create a self-sustaining city, full reusability is essential. Full
reusability is really the super-hard one. It is very difficult to
achieve reusability even for an orbital system, and that
challenge becomes substantially greater for a system that has
to go to another planet.
You could use any form of transport as an example of the
difference between reusability and expendability in aircraft. A
car, bicycle, horse, if they were single-use—almost no one
would use them; it would be too expensive. However, with
frequent flights, you can take an aircraft that costs $90
million and buy a ticket on Southwest right now from Los
Angeles to Vegas for $43, including taxes. If it were single
use, it would cost $500,000 per flight. Right there, you can
see an improvement of four orders of magnitude.
Now, this is harder—reusability does not apply quite as much
to Mars because the number of times that you can reuse the
spaceship pod of the system is less often because the Earth–
Mars rendezvous only occurs every 26 months. Therefore, you
get to use the spaceship part approximately every 2 years
