I was really excited to see all our Raptor engines firing
(Fig. 21). The Raptor is a really tricky engine. It is a lot trickier
than a Merlin because it is a full-flow stage combustion, with
much higher pressure. I am amazed that it did not blow up on
the first firing, but fortunately it was good.
Part of the reason for making the engine small, although it has three times the thrust of a Merlin, it is actually only about the same size as a Merlin engine
because it has three times the operating pressure. That
means we can use many of the production techniques that
we honed with Merlin.
We are currently producing Merlin engines at almost 300
per year. Therefore, we understand how to make rocket engines in volume. Hence, even though the Mars vehicle uses 42
on the base and nine on the upper stage—so we have 51 engines to make—that is well within our production capabilities
for Merlin. This is a similarly sized engine to Merlin, except
for the expansion ratio. We therefore feel really comfortable
about being able to make this engine in volume at a price that
does not break our budget.
