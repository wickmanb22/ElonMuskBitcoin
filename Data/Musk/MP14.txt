The net effect is a cargo to Mars of up to 450 tons, depending upon how many refills you do with the tanker. The
goal is at least 100 passengers per ship, although ultimately,
we will probably see that number grow to 200 or more.
Depending upon which Earth–Mars rendezvous you are
aiming for, the trip time at 6 km/s departure velocity can be as
low as 80 days (Fig. 14).
Over time, we would improve that, and, eventually, I suspect that you would see Mars transit times of as little as
30 days in the more distant future. It is fairly manageable,
considering the trips that people used to do in the old days
where sailing voyages would take 6 months or more.
On arrival, the heat-shield technology is extremely important (Fig. 15). We have been refining the heat-shield
technology using our Dragon spacecraft, and we are on
version 3 of PICA, which is a phenolic-impregnated carbon
ablator, and it is getting more robust with each new version with less ablation, more resistance, and less need for refurbishment.
The heat shield is basically a giant brake pad. It is a matter of
how good you can make that brake pad against extreme reentry conditions, minimize the cost of refurbishment, and
make it so that you could have many flights with no refurbishment at all.
I want to give you a sense of what it would feel like to
actually be in the spaceship. In order to make it appealing and
increase that portion of the Venn diagram where people actually want to go, it has got to be really fun and exciting—it
cannot feel cramped or boring. Therefore, the crew compartment or the occupant compartment is set up so that you can do
zero-gravity games—you can float around. There will be
movies, lecture halls, cabins, and a restaurant. It will be really
fun to go. You are going to have a great time!
