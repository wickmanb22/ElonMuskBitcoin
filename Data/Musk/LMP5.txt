When you seriously consider the idea of establishing a self-sustaining base on Mars or the Moon or elsewhere, you ultimately need thousands of ships and tens of thousands of refilling operations. This means you need many launches per day. In terms of how many landings are occurring, you need to be looking at your watch, not your calendar.

So while SpaceX's launch rate is quite high by conventional standards, it is still a very small launch rate compared to what will ultimately be needed (Fig. 3).
