We started the development with what are probably the
two most difficult key elements of the design of the interplanetary spaceship, the engine and rocket booster. The
Raptor engine is going to be the highest chamber pressure
engine of any kind ever built, and probably the highest
thrust-to-weight (Fig. 10).

It is a full-flow staged combustion engine, which maximizes the theoretical momentum that you can get out of a
given source fuel and oxidizer. We subcool the oxygen and
methane to densify it. Compared with when used close to
their boiling points in most rockets, in our case, we load the
propellants close to their freezing point. That can result in a
density improvement of around 10%â€“12%, which makes an
enormous difference in the actual result of the rocket. It gets
rid of any cavitation risk for the turbo pumps, and it makes it
easier to feed a high-pressure turbo pump if you have very
cold propellant.
One of the keys here, though, is the vacuum version of the
Raptor having a 382-second ISP. This is critical to the whole
Mars mission and we are confident we can get to that number
or at least within a few seconds of that number, ultimately
maybe even exceeding it slightly.
