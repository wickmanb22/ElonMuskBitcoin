For the spaceship itself, in the top, we have the pressurized
compartment. Then, beneath that is where we would have the
unpressurized cargo, which would be really flat-packedâ€”a very
dense format. Below that is the liquid oxygen tank (Fig. 13).
The liquid oxygen tank is probably the hardest piece of
this whole vehicle because it must handle propellant at the
coldest level and the tanks themselves actually form the
airframe. The airframe structure and the tank structure are
combined, as is the case in all modern rockets. In aircraft,
for example, the wing is really a fuel tank in the shape of
a wing.
The oxygen tank has to take the thrust loads of ascent and
the loads of reentry, and then it has to be impermeable to gaseous oxygen, which is tricky, and nonreactive to gaseous oxygen. Therefore, that is the most difficult piece of the spaceship
itself, which is also why we started on that element.

Below the oxygen tank is the fuel tank, and then the engines are mounted directly to the thrust cone on the base.
There are six of the high-efficiency vacuum engines around
the perimeter, and those do not gimbal. There are three of the
sea-level versions of the engine, which do gimbal and provide
the steering, although we can do some amount of steering
if you are in space with differential thrust on the outside
engines.
