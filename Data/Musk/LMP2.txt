This giant deep cryo liquid oxygen tank is actually a twelve meter tankâ€”you can see the relative scale of it in Figure 1. It's a thousand cubic meters of volume inside. That is actually more pressurized volume than an A380, to put that into perspective. We developed a new carbon fiber matrix that is much stronger and more capable at cryo than anything before, and it holds 1200 tons of liquid oxygen.

We successfully tested the tank up to its design pressure and then went a little further. We wanted to see where it would break, and we succeeded in that effort. It shot about 300 feet into the air, landed in the ocean and we fished it out. At this point we have got a pretty good sense of what it takes to create a huge carbon fiber tank that can hold cryogenic liquid. That is actually extremely important for making a light spaceship.
