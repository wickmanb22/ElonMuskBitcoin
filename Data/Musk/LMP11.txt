The ship is 48 meters in length. Dry mass is expected to be about 85 tons. Technically, our design says 75 tons but inevitably there will be mass growth. The ship will contain 1,100 tons of propellant with an ascent design of 150 tons and return mass of 50 tons. You can think of this as essentially combining the upper stage of the rocket with Dragonâ€”it is as if the Falcon 9 upper stage and Dragon were combined.

In Figure 6, you have the engine section in the rear, the propellant tanks in the middle and then a large payload bay in the front. That payload bay is actually eight stories tall. In fact, you can fit a whole stack of Falcon 1 rockets in the payload bay. Compared to the design I showed last time, you will see that there is a small delta wing at the back of the rocket. The reason for that is to expand the mission envelope of the BFR spaceship. Depending on whether you are landing or you are entering a planet or a moon that has no atmosphere, a thin atmosphere, or a dense atmosphere, and depending on whether you are reentering with no payload in the front, a small payload, or a heavy payload, you have to balance the rocket out as it is coming in. The delta wing at the back, which also includes a split flap for pitch and roll control, allows us to control the pitch angle despite having a wide range of payloads in the nose and a wide range of atmospheric densities. We tried to avoid having the delta wing but it was necessary in order to generalize the capability of the spaceship such that it could land anywhere in the solar system.
