We also wanted to make progress on the primary structure.
As I mentioned, this is really a very difficult thing to make out
of carbon fiber, even though carbon fiber has incredible
strength to weight. When you then want to put super-cold. We also wanted to make progress on the primary structure.

development tank for the Mars spaceship. This is really the
hardest part of the spaceship. The other pieces we have a pretty
good handle on, but this was the trickiest one so we wanted to
tackle it first.
This was a massive achievement. Huge congratulations are
due to the team that worked on it. We managed to build the
first tank, and the initial test with the cryogenic propellant
actually looks quite positive. We have not seen any leaks or
major issues.
Figure 22 is what the tank looks like on the inside. You
get a real sense of just how big this tank is. It is completely
smooth on the inside, but the way that the carbon fiber
applies, lays up, and reflects the light makes it look multifaceted.
