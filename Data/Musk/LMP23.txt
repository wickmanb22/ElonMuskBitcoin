For Mars entry, you are entering very quickly, going seven and a half kilometers a second. For Mars, there will be some ablation of the heat shield, sort of like a brake pad wearing away. It is a multi-use heat shield, but unlike for Earth operations, it is coming in hot enough that you really will see some wear of the heat shield.
Because Mars has an atmosphere, albeit not a particularly dense one, you can remove almost all the energy aerodynamically. And we have proven out supersonic retropropulsion many times with Falcon 9, so we feel very comfortable about that.
