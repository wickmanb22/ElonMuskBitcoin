You would get to use the booster and the tanker frequently.
Therefore, it makes sense to load the spaceship into orbit with
essentially tanks dry. If it has really big tanks that you use the
booster and tanker to refill once in orbit, you can maximize
the payload of the spaceship, so when it goes to Mars, you
have a very large payload capability.
Hence, refilling in orbit is one of the essential elements of
this (Table 2). Without refilling in orbit, you would have
roughly a half order of magnitude impact on the cost. What
that means is that each order of magnitude is a factor of 10.
Therefore, not refilling in orbit would mean roughly a 500%
increase in the cost per ticket.
It also allows us to build a smaller vehicle and lower the
development cost, although this is still quite big. However, it
would be much harder to build something that is 5â€“10 times
the size. Furthermore, it reduces the sensitivity of the performance
characteristics of the booster rocket and tanker. So, if there is a
shortfall in the performance of any of the elements, you can
make up for it by having one or two extra refilling trips to the
spaceship. This is very important for reducing the susceptibility of the system to a performance shortfall.
