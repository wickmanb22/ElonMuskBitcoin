What about beyond Mars? As we thought about the system
and the reason we call it a system—because generally, I do not like calling things ‘‘systems,’’ as everything is a system, including your dog. However, it is actually more than a vehicle.
There is obviously the rocket booster, the spaceship, the
tanker and the propellant plant, and the in situ propellant
production.
If you have all four of these elements, you can go anywhere
in the solar system by planet hopping or moon hopping. By
establishing a propellant depot on the asteroid belt or on one
of the moons of Jupiter, you can make flights from Mars to
Jupiter. In fact, even without a propellant depot at Mars, you
can do a flyby of Jupiter (Fig. 23). However, by establishing a propellant depot, say on Enceladus (Fig. 24) or Europa (Fig. 25), and then establishing
another one on Titan, Saturn’s moon, and then perhaps another one further out on Pluto or elsewhere in the solar system,
this system really gives you the freedom to go anywhere you
want in the greater solar system (Fig. 26).
Therefore, you could travel out to the Kuiper Belt, to the
Oort cloud. I would not recommend this for interstellar journeys, but this basic system—provided we have filling stations along the way—means full access to the entire greater
solar system.
