In 2002, SpaceX basically consisted of carpet and a mariachi band. That was it. I thought we had maybe a 10%
chance of doing anything—of even getting a rocket to orbit,
let alone getting beyond that and taking Mars seriously. However, I came to the conclusion that if there were no
new entrants into the space arena with a strong ideological
motivation, then it did not seem as if we were on a trajectory
to ever be a space-based civilization and be out there among
the stars.
In 1969, we were able to go to the moon, and the space
shuttle could get to low Earth orbit. Then the space shuttle was
retired. However, that trend line is down to zero. What many
people do not appreciate is that technology does not automatically improve; it only improves if a lot of really strong
engineering talent is applied to the problem. There are many
examples in history where civilizations have reached a certain
technology level, fallen well below that, and then recovered
only millennia later.
We went from 2002, where we basically were clueless, and
we built the smallest, useful orbital rocket that we could think
of with Falcon 1, which would deliver half a ton to orbit. Four
years later, we developed the first vehicle. We developed the
main engine, the upper-stage engine, the airframes, the fairing, and the launch system, and we had our first attempt at
launch in 2006, which failed. It lasted about 60 seconds, unfortunately.
However, 2006, 4 years after starting, was also when we got
our first NASA contract (Fig. 18). I am incredibly grateful to NASA for supporting SpaceX, despite the fact that our rocket
crashed. I am NASA’s biggest fan. Thank you very much to the
people who had the faith to do that.
