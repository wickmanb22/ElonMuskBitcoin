The ingredients are there on Mars to create a propellant plant
with relative ease because the atmosphere is primarily CO2, and
water-ice is almost everywhere. There is CO2 plus H2O to make
methane, CH4, and oxygen, O2, using the Sabatier reaction.
The trickiest thing really is the energy source, which can be
done with a large field of solar panels (Fig. 16).
