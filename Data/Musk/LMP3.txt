The next key element is on the engine side. We have to have an extremely efficient engine; the Raptor engine will be the highest thrust-to-weight engine, we believe, of any engine of any kind ever made. We already have 1200 seconds of firing across 42 main engine tests. We have fired Raptor for as long as 100 seconds. It could fire for much longer than 100 seconds, this is just a reflection of the size of the test tanks. The duration of the firing for landing on Mars is about 40 seconds. The test engine currently operates at 200 atmospheres, or 200 bar, the flight engine will be at 250 bar, and then we believe over time we could probably get that to a little over 300 bar.
