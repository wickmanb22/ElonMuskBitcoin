There has been a lot of great work by NASA and other
organizations in the early exploration of Mars and understanding what Mars is like. Where could we land? What is the
composition of the atmosphere? Where is there water or ice?
We need to go from these early exploration missions to actually building a city.
The issue that we have today is that if you look at a Venn
diagram, there is no intersection of sets—of people who want
to go and those who can afford to go (Fig. 2). In fact, right
now, you cannot go to Mars for infinite money.
Using traditional methods, taking an Apollo-style approach, an optimistic cost would be about $10 billion per
person. Taking the Apollo program as an example, the cost
estimates are somewhere between $100 and $200 billion in current-year dollars, and we sent 12 people to the surface of
the moon, which was an incredible thing—probably one of the
greatest achievements of humanity.
However, that is a steep price to pay for a ticket. That is why
these circles barely touch (Fig. 3). You cannot create a selfsustaining civilization if the ticket price is $10 billion per
person. What we need to do is to move those circles together
(Fig. 4). If we can get the cost of moving to Mars to be roughly
equivalent to a median house price in the United States, which
is around $200,000, then I think the probability of establishing
a self-sustaining civilization is very high. I think it would
almost certainly occur.
Not everyone would want to go. In fact, probably a relatively small number of people from Earth would want to go,
but enough would want to go who could afford it for it to
happen. People could also get sponsorship. It gets to the point
where almost anyone, if they saved up and this was their goal, could buy a ticket and move to Mars—and given that Mars
would have a labor shortage for a long time, jobs would not be
in short supply.
