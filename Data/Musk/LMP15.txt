For refilling, the two ships would actually mate at the rear section. They would use the same mating interface that they used to connect to the booster on lift-off. We would reuse that mating interface and reuse the propellant fill lines that are used when the ship is on the booster. To transfer propellant, it becomes very simpleâ€”use control thrusters to accelerate in the direction that you want to empty. If you accelerate in this direction, propellant goes that way, and you transfer the propellant very easily from the tanker to the ship.
