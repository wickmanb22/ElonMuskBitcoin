It is also intended to be able to service the space station (Fig. 11). I know it looks a little big relative to the space station but the Shuttle also looked bigâ€”so it will work. It will be capable of doing what Dragon does today in terms of transporting cargo and what Dragon 2 will do in terms of transporting crew and cargo. It can also go out to much further than that, like for example, the Moon.
