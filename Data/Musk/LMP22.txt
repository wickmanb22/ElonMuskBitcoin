It is the same approach that I mentioned before, which is to send the spaceship up to orbit, refill it until it has full tanks, and then it travels to Mars and lands (Fig. 14). For Mars, you will need local propellant production. But Mars has a CO2 atmosphere and plenty of water ice. That gives you CO2 and H2O, so therefore you can make CH4 and O2 using the Sabatier Process. I should mention that, long term, this can also be done on Earth. Sometimes I get some criticism along the lines of: “Why are you using combustion in rockets and you have electric cars?” Well there is no way to make an electric rocket, I wish there was, but in the long term you can use solar power to extract CO2 from the atmosphere, combine it with water and produce fuel and oxygen for the rocket. The same thing that we're doing on Mars, we could do on Earth in the long term.

Similar to the Moon, you land on Mars, but the tricky thing with Mars is we do need to build a propellant depot to refill the tanks and return to Earth. Because Mars has lower gravity than Earth, you do not need a booster—you can go all the way from the surface of Mars to the surface of Earth just using the ship. You need a max payload number of about 20 to 50 tons for the return journey to work, but it is a single stage all the way back to Earth.
