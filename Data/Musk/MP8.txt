Picking the right propellant is also important. There are
three main choices, and they each have their merits (Table 4).
First, there is kerosene, or rocket propellant-grade kerosene,
essentially a highly refined form of jet fuel. It helps keep the
vehicle size small, but because it is a very specialized form
of jet fuel, it is quite expensive. Its reusability potential
is lower. It would be very difficult to make this on Mars because there is no oil. Propellant transfer is pretty good but
not great.
Hydrogen, although it has a high specific impulse, is very
expensive, and it is incredibly difficult to keep from boiling
off because liquid hydrogen is very close to absolute zero as a
liquid. Therefore, the installation required is tremendous, and
the energy cost on Mars of producing and storing hydrogen
would be very high.
Therefore, when we looked at the overall system optimization, it was clear that methane was the clear winner.
Methane would require from 50% to 60% of the energy on
Mars to refill propellant using the propellant depot, and the
technical challenges are a lot easier. We therefore think
methane is better almost across the board.
We started off initially thinking that hydrogen would
make sense, but ultimately came to the conclusion that the
best way to optimize the cost-per-unit mass to Mars and back
is to use an all-methane systemâ€”or technically, deep-cryo
methalox.
Whatever system is designed, whether by SpaceX or
someone else, these are the four features that need to be addressed in order for the system really to achieve a low cost per
ton to the surface of Mars
